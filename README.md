# JunkCtrl
Take ctrl (Catarl or Control) over the junk that ends up on your Windows 11 system

Windows 11 stock apps eat a lot of your disk space. Some are helpful, others feel as bloatware. 
                       This app can automatically scan your system for bloatware and remove it in the same step.
                       You can also take the manual route and use an assistant.
                       

Before removal, the apps are moved to the recycle bin. This should be one of the safest methods to remove the correct bloatware and avoid accidentally deleting the wrong app.
