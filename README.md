# JunkCtrl
Take ctrl (Catarl or Control) over the junk that ends up on your Windows 11 system. 
    
## About JunkCtrl
**Its' here.**
**Its mission: removing junk, and it's really good at it.**

This app can greatly help declutter beautiful Windows 11. Windows 11 stock apps eat a lot of your disk space. Some are helpful, others feel as bloatware. 
This app can automatically scan your system for junk apps and remove it in the same step.
You can also take the manual route and use an assistant. Before removal, the apps are moved to the recycle bin.
                       
This should be one of the safest methods to remove the correct bloatware and avoid accidentally deleting the wrong app. (Please use this one ONLY for Windows 11. For Windows 10, [BloatBox](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox) is still available. This is also the replacement app for Bloatbox)

You might think it's redundant since we have [BloatyNosy](https://github.com/builtbybel/BloatyNosy) on W11 which features also an "Debloater". It's not entirely true. This one goes further and could potentially take on more in the future. 

Perhaps a part of [Cleanmgr+](https://github.com/builtbybel/CleanmgrPlus ) could be brought into Junkctrl. I never managed to fully migrate Cleanmgr+ to .Net_

**The only thing missing for Junkctrl now is an app icon. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.**

## Info
If you know potentially dangerous apps (fake, spyware, stolen and resold code) in MS Store please feel free to share them [here](https://github.com/builtbybel/JunkCtrl/issues/7) Attempting to provide a small signature file that exposes this junk. It is definitely there.
